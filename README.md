# CS336 Spring 2025 Assignment 1: Basics

### Status
#### BPE
Code for this is in cs336_basics/scratch_bpe.py/ pretoken_stuff.py. Jist is as follows:
- Pretokenization uses multiprocessing, each subprocess has a sorted list of pretokens and their counts. These are merged into a list of Pretoken objects once all the subprocesses are done.
- Once this is done a hash of AlphabetPair objects is constructed. For each iteration of the algorithm
    - The most common pair is determined (linear scan)
    - Iterates over the pretokens that contain that pair, the pair is replaced, and any new pairs are added to the hash

### Description

### Environment
We manage our environments with `uv` to ensure reproducibility, portability, and ease of use.
Install `uv` [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended), or run `pip install uv`/`brew install uv`.
We recommend reading a bit about managing projects in `uv` [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#managing-dependencies) (you will not regret it!).

You can now run any code in the repo using
```sh
uv run <python_file_path>
```
and the environment will be automatically solved and activated when necessary.

### Run unit tests


```sh
uv run pytest
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).
